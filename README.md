# prolog-shenanigans
Learning Prolog for fun-seems really powerful

Simple prolog program which will help understand how prolog handles list, understanding predicates(which are just functions), an advanced program at the end shows how N-queens is implemented and shortest distance between two points. Even Knapsack has an easy implementation here. This shows many famous problems can be reduced to recursion and solved with the power of prolog.
